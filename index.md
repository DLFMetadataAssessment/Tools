# DLF AIG MWG Metadata Assessment Tools

This is a currently ongoing area of work of the DLF Assessment Interest Group (AIG) Metadata Working Group (MWG). The goal of this work will be a metadata assessment tools repository, with information on tools and how they can be used to support metadata assessment. The work that has been done so far includes:

- - -- [A preliminary list of metadata assessment tools and information on those tools](https://dlfmetadataassessment.github.io/Framework/entries/41framework.html#Select_the_right_tools)
- - -- Developing material to test tools to augment the information we have
A working lunch session in support of this work will also happen at DLF Forum 2017.
